# Machine Learning Project2, Multiple Sclerosis (MS-disease)

## Dataset:
Multiple Sclerosis (MS-disease). https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/conversion-predictors-of-cis-to-multiple-sclerosis

## Dataset content:
Prospective cohort study was conducted in Mexican mestizo patients newly diagnosed with CIS who presented at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery (NINN) in Mexico City, Mexico, between 2006 and 2010.

## Machine Learning project purpose:
- Classification of MS-disease.
- Using many different ML classification algorithms find the best algorithm.
- Test also NN-model with same dataset.

## Machine Learning project results:
- It was possible to get high accuracy, 89% with ML algorithm.
